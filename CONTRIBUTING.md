# DeepTools Contribution Guidelines #

Here are a few rules and guidelines you need to follow if you want to contribute

It's much appreciated if you do decide to contribute something, whether it is
 an issue or a pull request!

For any sort of contribution you will need to accept and follow the
 [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Here's the short version if you don't
 have the time to read through it all: *Don't be a dick to anyone.*  
I have nothing against swearing or joking around, but don't go too far.  
Everyone should feel welcome and accepted here, doesn't matter who they are.

The main and only language in this repository is **English**. Please refrain
 from speaking any other language.  
Nobody will go after you for writing a few words in another language, just don't
 write entire sentences in a language that isn't English.

This project **strictly** adheres to [Semantic Versioning] and a
 [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) file is kept based on the [Keep a Changelog] format.

[Creating a new issue] is an easy and fast way to contribute.  
There are several issue templates to help you contribute suggestions, requests,
 reports or questions. While it is recommended to use these templates, it's not
 mandatory.

 always use the pull request template.
