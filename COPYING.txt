All files should contain a SPDX short-form identifier to declare under which license they are published.
A SPDX short-form identifier takes the form of:

        SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression>

... and is most of the time placed somewhere at the top of a file.
Read more about SPDX short-form identifiers here: <https://spdx.dev/ids/>

A copyright notice in the form of:

        Copyright (c) <year> <copyright holder>

... should also be present near the SPDX short-form identifier if the license is not
the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal. (as in this case a copyright notice wouldn't make sense)


Files in which a SPDX short-form identifier cannot be used or does not fit (for whatever reason) are listed here.
All of these files are published into the public domain under Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal:

        .eslintrc.json
        .github/issue_labels.json
        .github/pull_request_template.md
        .mocharc.json
        COPYING.txt  (this file)
        LICENSE.txt
        package.json


All files that don't contain a SPDX short-form identifier, are not listed above and don't contain any other sort of
copyright and/or license header are verbatim copies from their original sources.
Copyright belongs to their respectful authors. (this includes all files in the 'LICENSES' directory)
Correct attribution should be found somewhere in these files.


The individual licenses, used in this repository, can be found in the 'LICENSES' directory and are also listed here:
